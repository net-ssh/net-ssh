      # A session class representing the connection service running on top of
      # the SSH transport layer. It manages the creation of channels (see
      # #open_channel), and the dispatching of messages to the various channels.
      # It also encapsulates the SSH event loop (via #loop and #process),
      # and serves as a central point-of-reference for all SSH-related services (e.g.
      # port forwarding, SFTP, SCP, etc.).
      #
      # You will rarely (if ever) need to instantiate this class directly; rather,
